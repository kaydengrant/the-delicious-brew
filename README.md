# The Delicious Brew
An e-commerce and blog mock website about one of my personal hobbies: brewing coffee. This website was primarily made for the purpose of learning how to develop and maintain a shop (products, cart, payment) as well as a blog (posts, messages).

### Live Website [The Delicious Brew](https://thedeliciousbrew.vercel.app/)
### Figma Wireframe [Click Here](https://www.figma.com/file/LfO2K6hXItikkrtOXn9K2P/delicious-brew?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=P67gMuzhEQWCtZg7-1)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```
Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
